Tracks inventory and provides analytics for the donation service organization, The Locker

Currently tracks $15k of supplies such as backpacks, water bottles, and more!


## Demo

In the video, you can first see how a user can easily checkout items from the database. Then, you can see from an admin perspective the updates to the analytics and how to add/delete items.
